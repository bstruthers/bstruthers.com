# Hitting the reset button

## Here we are...

Many years ago, when the web was young, blogging was the de facto way to share your thoughts and experiences. 3rd party blogging providers were an easy way to let the world hear your voice. One of the most common projects to learn a new language or web framework was to create and host your own blogging solution.

Over the years I've created blogs using the [LAMP stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)>), [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the [MEAN stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)>), and many other frameworks that I've long since forgotten. Eventually, I no longer had any time to keep up with the ever changing landscape and maintain what I had built, worrying about SEO and making sure I could be googled, looking at who was visiting and what. My personal site slowly stopped getting updates and eventually just became a static HTML page.

For a while, I've wanted to blow the dust off of my site and get back into writing my thoughts down. Primarily, so I have a place I can look when I'm trying to recall how I solved a particular problem or situation. But if someone else can find value in my thoughts, then doubly worth sharing them.

With that in mind, I decided to recreate a blogging framework.  I don't want to chasing the shiniest object I can find. I want to keep it simple and use what I know. And maybe pick up on a few things along the way.

This time, my site will use Angular, Nrwl's nx framework, and Markdown for the content. These are tools I use day in and out for my job. Nothing too fancy. All the source code for the framework is available on [github](https://github.com/bstruthers/nx-weblog). As I created the framework, I wrote about things as I went. Dog fooding my blog... or blog fooding for a really lame dad joke.

It won't be perfect, it won't have all the bells and whistles that can be found elsewhere. But it's mine and a start of me sharing my thoughts again to whoever might be reading.
